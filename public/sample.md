# Custom Markdown Example

This is a sample Markdown document to demonstrate various elements like text, code blocks, and paragraphs.

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. It's designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats. It's very popular among writers, developers, and content creators for its simplicity and flexibility.

## Code Example

Here's an example of a code block in JavaScript:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("World");
```

**Note**: Be aware that the triple backticks used to delimit the code block in the Markdown example above might be interpreted as closing the code block in this response. When using this in a Markdown editor or viewer, it should display correctly.
